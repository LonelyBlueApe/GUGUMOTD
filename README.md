## **RULES**
1. NO FFA
2. NO CHEATING
3. NO EXPLOITS
4. X + 1 (flourish) To initiate duel
5. No racism, bigotry, hate-speech, etc. in chat.
6. No troll (racism, bigotry, hate-speech, etc.) songs in the radio
7. Try not to play the same song more than 3 times in a row because it gets annoying for the rest of the server (using multiple people to bypass this rule is still breaking the rule.)
8. Don't walk in the middle of other people's duel or interrupt duels purposefully in any way.

We have a “3rd strike out” policy on our server which means if you get warned 3 times you get banned (not permanently). The first warning is just that, you get a warning to correct your behavior. The second warning will only be a kick from the server. The third warning is a 60-minute ban and every warning after that doubles the time banned (4th is 120, 5th is 240, etc.) But there are exceptions to this where if you were warned for breaking rule 5 then you might also receive a mute (the duration of mute is chosen by the staff that issued the mute based on how severe the offense was). Another example is if you have 0 warnings but get caught cheating, you will be permanently banned as well as being reported to Triternion.

If you believe your punishment was unjust, you can appeal it in our <a id="Discord server.">https://discord.gg/k23ZckC2Z9</>

If you ever witness a member of our staff team abusing their power or behaving problematically, please take a video clip and or screenshot (provided it constitutes sufficient evidence) that includes their PlayFabID. Then, submit a ticket on our <a id="Discord server,">https://discord.gg/k23ZckC2Z9</> and we will conduct a thorough investigation.
