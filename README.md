We have a “3rd strike out” policy on our server which means if you get warned 3 times you get banned (not permanently). The first warning is just that, you get a warning to correct your behavior. The second warning will only be a kick from the server. The third warning is a 60-minute ban and every warning after that doubles the time banned (4th is 120, 5th is 240, etc.) But there are exceptions to this where if you were warned for breaking rule 5 then you might also receive a mute (the duration of mute is chosen by the staff that issued the mute based on how severe the offense was). Another example is if you have 0 warnings but get caught cheating, you will be permanently banned as well as being reported to Triternion. Thank you for reading and enjoy your time on the server!\n
